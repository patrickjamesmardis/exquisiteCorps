      <h2>A QUEST!</h2>
      <p>Ezekial is leaving his glade for the first time. He has been tasked from the glade leader to find treasure.
      </p>
      <p> The glade has befallen tough times of recent. It was not the time to invest in GME. </p>
      <p> Neither was it AMC... </p>
      <p> The glade had pawned their bitcoin mining computer. </p>
      <p>DOGE was the only answer.</p>

      <h2>An ORIGIN?!</h2>
      <p>Oh Elon Musk, the man with the plan. But is he really a man? Let's find out.</p>
      <p>z3_leoN (otherwise known as Elon) was born quintillions of years ago. He was just a small dwarf planet boy,
        living in a lonely celestial sphere. So what did he do? He took the midnight inter-galactic
        light-dimension-warping train going anywhere.</p>
      <p>Where did he land? On the planet of Earth. On Earth he set up an empire of electric cars, cool space ships, and
        perhaps most important, the coin of d0ge.</p>
      <p>He awaits anxiously for the arrival of someone looking to learn about the ways of the canine coin...</p>

      <h2>November 2, 2005</h2>
      <p>Atsuko patiently awaited the arrival of her daughter Kabosu, and even more patiently for Elon's teachings of
        the doge. Kabosu was blessed with a plan, much like z3_leoN, and came to fame as: </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Doge</p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a
          href=" https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1357231313376456708?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 4, 2021</a>
      </blockquote>
      <p>But was Doge really just a doge?</p>
      <p>Well, about a quadrillion years ago, when z3_leoN was developing his plan of an emerald empire, he studied
        under 1a=cr01* the greatest shapeshifter of the galaxy. While z3_leoN's been known to study cloning himself into
        a doge, nobody's been able to prove it yet.</p>

    <section class="paragraph-4">
      <h2>November 17, 2005</h2>
      <p>As Kabosu arrived home, Atsuko immediately noticed something was off, but what could it be?</p>
      <p>Kabosu had spent years training under z3_leoN's tutelage, but returned home seemingly unchanged.</p>
      <p>Atsuko held this feeling to herself and quitely sstudied her daughter when suddenly it struck her.</p>
      <p>Her daughter had NOT held on to the way of the Doge and had sold.</p>
      <p>She was not, in fact, riding the way of the Doge to the moon.</p>
      <p>She had abandoned her teachings and her Doge-laden brethren for something far darker.</p>
