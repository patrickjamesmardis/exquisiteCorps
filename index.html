        <h2>A QUEST!</h2>
        <p>Ezekial is leaving his glade for the first time. He has been tasked from the glade leader to find treasure.
        </p>
        <p> The glade has befallen tough times of recent. It was not the time to invest in GME. </p>
        <p> Neither was it AMC... </p>
        <p> The glade had pawned their bitcoin mining computer. </p>
        <p>DOGE was the only answer.</p>

        <h2>An ORIGIN?!</h2>
        <p>Oh Elon Musk, the man with the plan. But is he really a man? Let's find out.</p>
        <p>z3_leoN (otherwise known as Elon) was born quintillions of years ago. He was just a small dwarf planet boy,
          living in a lonely celestial sphere. So what did he do? He took the midnight inter-galactic
          light-dimension-warping train going anywhere.</p>
        <p>Where did he land? On the planet of Earth. On Earth he set up an empire of electric cars, cool space ships,
          and
          perhaps most important, the coin of d0ge.</p>
        <p>He awaits anxiously for the arrival of someone looking to learn about the ways of the canine coin...</p>

        <h2>November 2, 2005</h2>
        <p>Atsuko patiently awaited the arrival of her daughter Kabosu, and even more patiently for Elon's teachings of
          the doge. Kabosu was blessed with a plan, much like z3_leoN, and came to fame as: </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Doge</p>
          <p class="small">&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a
              href=" https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1357231313376456708?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 4, 2021</a>
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>But was Doge really just a doge?</p>
        <p>Well, about a quadrillion years ago, when z3_leoN was developing his plan of an emerald empire, he studied
          under 1a=cr01* the greatest shapeshifter of the galaxy. While z3_leoN's been known to study cloning himself
          into
          a doge, nobody's been able to prove it yet.</p>

        <h2>November 17, 2005</h2>
        <p>As Kabosu arrived home, Atsuko immediately noticed something was off, but what could it be?</p>
        <p>Kabosu had spent years training under z3_leoN's tutelage, but returned home seemingly unchanged.</p>
        <p>Atsuko held this feeling to herself and quitely studied her daughter when suddenly it struck her.</p>
        <p>Her daughter had NOT held on to the way of the Doge and had sold.</p>
        <p>She was not, in fact, riding the way of the Doge to the moon.</p>
        <p>She had abandoned her teachings and her Doge-laden brethren for something far darker.</p>

        <p> She looked down at her hands and quickly realized that they were not in fact Diamond. This tore through her
          sole and sent her to an even more evil and manipulative scheme. </p>
        <p>Kabosu recognized that there was no way to be able to make up the fortunes of the Fearless. Except possibly
          one. </p>
        <p>She knew she had to go bigger and better. Something she could really control. Instead of leaving the tribes
          fate with Father Elon. </p>
        <p>She stole the tribe computer and hid away in a distant cave. Putting all of her money into Busta Bit. </p>
        <p>"10X multiplier, 20X multiplier, 30X multiplier, or to play it safe" thought Kabuso</p>
        <p>Having put all of the money into one let it ride attempt like Magnus Carleson sacrificing his queen in the
          2016
          Grand Master Chess Championship, would the fabled busta bit, bust or produce bits? </p>

        <h2>December 25th, 2006</h2>
        <p>Christmas. A day of celebration. Not in this case though.</p>
        <p>Kabosu made a gamble. She thought she knew the ways of the stonks, and how they affected the ways of the
          coin.
          Unfortunately her Busta Bit did not bust a profit. She followed the bit stonks along intensely, watching as
          the
          gamble went through a series of peaks and valleys.</p>
        <p>She reverted back to her base instinct, the one that has brought her eons of mysery, selling for a 382% loss.
        </p>
        <p>What did this mean for her, and her tribe?</p>
        <p>Well, there will be no eggnog on Christmas. No porridge. No mf Tamagotchi stocking stuffers neither. They
          were
          fucked.</p>
        <p>Because of her actions she was exhiled from her tribe, so she went out to make ammends with the man with a
          plan, and bring honor back to her tribe.</p>

        <h2>January 24, 2007</h2>
        <p>The man with the plan listened intently as Kabosu detailed her misfortunate gamble and replied with a simple
          question to ponder: to short, or not to short?</p>
        <p>After her 382% Busta Bit blowout, she was sure prices would keep dropping. So, she put every cent she still
          had
          back in a short position, claiming z3_leoN told her it was her best bet.</p>
        <p>z3leoN, however, had no intention of Kabosu actually shorting all her money. This destroyed his ancient plan.
          Everything was going to be lost. Busta Bit was going to make a comeback, putting Kabosu at an 869% loss when
          she
          finally decides return the shares she borrowed.</p>
        <p>The man with the plan no longer had a plan.</p>
        <p>The man with no plan needed to rebirth into the man with the plan.</p>

        <p>In the aftermath of Kabosu's egregious misstep, all was lost.</p>
        <p>Kabosu, coinless and destitute, took to a life of crime when one day she crossed paths with her ols master, z3_leoN.</p>
        <p>It was in the market and z3_leoN was dressed head to toe in the finest garb.</p>
        <p>They exchanged a tense, wordless glance that had told them both everything they needed to know.</p>
        <p>z3_leoN had won.</p>
        <p>... or did he?</p>
